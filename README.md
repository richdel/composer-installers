Simple modification of AOEPeople's Magento Composer Installers which by default installs modules into the .modman/ directory in a containing folder dicated by the module name extracted from the composer name key value which is in the format of 'vendor/modulename'. This could lead to ambiguity so if the vendor exists this proposed modification installs the module to 'project_root/.modman/vendor_modulename'.
